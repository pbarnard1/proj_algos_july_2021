# Tips for solving algorithms

1. Read the problem several times.  Understand what the inputs will be, if there are any.  Also note if you're returning a value.
2. Make up some examples - or cases.  Try to solve the problem by hand.  I encourage you to make up your own cases - especially edge cases.
3. Explain in plain words how you're solving the problem - without relying on code at first.  Then once you have the general procedure nailed down, start writing code.
4. You might pseudocode handy when you're solving the problem.  This will help you determine what variables you'll need, what kinds of code blocks you'll use (e.g. for loops, while loops, if statements).
5. Once you've written your method(s) out, test it - A LOT - with your test cases to make sure it works.

In an interview:
- Ask clarifying questions - sometimes the problems are intentionally vague to make sure ask questions.  For example, "Can we assume a given array is sorted?" or "Will the inputs be (positive) integers?".
- Talk out your thought process - think of the game show "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?", where you have to talk out your thought process to get the right answer - same idea in an interview.
- You might be asked to solve a problem multiple ways.  Often you'll have to talk about space and time complexity - big O notation (more to come in Tuesday's lecture).
